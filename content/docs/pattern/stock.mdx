## Code Pattern

<Scrollycoding>

## !!steps Base Case

1. `n`: Number of price points. Adjust `k` based on whether transactions are unlimited.
2. `if k >= n // 2:` checks if the number of allowed transactions (k) is at least half the number of price points (n). This means the trader can effectively buy and sell freely.
3. `sum(max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n))` calculates total profit:
    - `prices[i] - prices[i - 1]:` Computes daily price changes.
    - `max(0, ...):` Ensures only positive changes (profits) are counted.
    - `sum(...):` Adds up all the profitable changes.

```python !code
# !mark(1:14) gold
def BasicProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int], max_txn: int = float('inf')) -> int:
    """
    Universal solution for all stock trading problems
    k: number of transactions allowed (use float('inf') for unlimited)
    prices: list of stock prices
    max_txn: maximum number of transactions allowed
    """

    n = len(prices)
    k = min(k, n//2) if max_txn == float('inf') else max_txn
    
    # For unlimited transactions, use greedy approach
    if k >= n//2:
        return sum(max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]) for i in range(1, n))
```

## !!steps Dynamic Programming

4. `dp[k][0]` represents maximum profit at k transactions without holding stock
5. `dp[k][1]` represents maximum profit at k transactions while holding stock

```python !code
def BasicProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int], max_txn: int = float('inf')) -> int:
    """
    Universal solution for all stock trading problems
    k: number of transactions allowed (use float('inf') for unlimited)
    prices: list of stock prices
    max_txn: maximum number of transactions allowed
    """

    n = len(prices)
    k = min(k, n//2) if max_txn == float('inf') else max_txn
    
    # For unlimited transactions, use greedy approach
    if k >= n//2:
        return sum(max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]) for i in range(1, n))

    # !mark(1:2) gold
    dp = [[-float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
```

## !!steps Union function

6. `dp[j][0] = max(dp[j][0], dp[j][1] + price)` updates the maximum profit when not holding stock (either stay in that state or sell stock).
7. `dp[j][1] = max(dp[j][1], dp[j-1][0] - price)` updates the maximum profit while holding stock (either stay in that state or buy stock).

```python !code
def BasicProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int], max_txn: int = float('inf')) -> int:
    """
    Universal solution for all stock trading problems
    k: number of transactions allowed (use float('inf') for unlimited)
    prices: list of stock prices
    max_txn: maximum number of transactions allowed
    """

    n = len(prices)
    k = min(k, n//2) if max_txn == float('inf') else max_txn
    
    # For unlimited transactions, use greedy approach
    if k >= n//2:
        return sum(max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]) for i in range(1, n))

    dp = [[-float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    # !mark(1:10) gold
    for price in prices:
        for j in range(k, 0, -1):
            # Update maximum profit when we have j transactions
            # Without holding stock
            dp[j][0] = max(dp[j][0], dp[j][1] + price)
            # While holding stock
            dp[j][1] = max(dp[j][1], dp[j-1][0] - price)
            
    return max(0, max(dp[i][0] for i in range(k + 1)))
```

## Common mistakes

1. Wrong DP Array Initialization

```python
# Wrong: using 0 instead of -inf
dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]  # Can't track losses properly
# Wrong: forgetting to set initial state
dp = [[-float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]  # Forgot dp[0][0] = 0
# Correct:
dp = [[-float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(k + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 0  # Initial state with no transactions
```

2. Incorrect Return Value

```python
# Wrong: not handling negative profits
return dp[k][0]  # Doesn't handle case where no transaction is better
# Wrong: forgetting to check all transaction counts
return max(dp[k][0], 0)  # Might miss better profit with fewer transactions
# Correct:
return max(0, max(dp[i][0] for i in range(k + 1)))
```
