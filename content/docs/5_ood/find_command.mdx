## Basic

Q: Design a Unix File Search API that allows users to search for files based on various criteria, such as:

1. File Extension: Search for files with specific extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`).
2. File Size: Search for files within a specified size range (e.g., greater than 1MB, less than 100KB).
3. File Name: Search for files that match a specific name or pattern.

The design should be flexible and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of new search criteria in the future (e.g., by date modified, by owner). Additionally, the API should support combining search criteria using logical operators, such as AND and OR, to enable complex queries.


A: We can use the **Specification Pattern** combined with the **Builder Pattern**. This design will ensure that the API is maintainable and extensible for future requirements.



## Code Template


<Scrollycoding>

## !!steps Abstract Class And Subclasses

1. This abstract class `FileSpec` defines the interface for all spec. It contains a method `is_satisfied_by` that checks if a given file meets the speci.
2. Subclasses inherit from FileSpec and implements the `is_satisfied_by` method.


```python !code
class FileSpec:
    def is_satisfied_by(self, file: File) -> bool:
        # Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
        pass

class ExtensionSpec(FileSpec):
    def __init__(self, extension: str):
        self.extension = extension

    def is_satisfied_by(self, file: File) -> bool:
        # Check if the file's extension matches the specified extension
        return file.extension == self.extension

class SizeSpec(FileSpec):
    def __init__(self, size: int, comparator: str):
        self.size = size
        self.comparator = comparator

    def is_satisfied_by(self, file: File) -> bool:
        # Create a dictionary mapping operators to boolean expressions
        if self.comparator not in ops:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid comparator: {self.comparator}")
        ops = {
            '>': file.size > self.size,
            '<': file.size < self.size,
            '=': file.size == self.size}
        return ops.get(self.comparator, False)
```

## !!steps Two Specifications

3. `AndSpec` class allows the combination of multiple spec using a logical AND operation.
It checks if a file satisfies all the provided spec.
4. `OrSpec` class allows the combination of multiple spec using a logical OR operation.
It checks if a file satisfies at least one of the provided spec.

```python !code
class AndSpec(FileSpec):
    def __init__(self, *spec: FileSpec):
        self.spec = spec

    def is_satisfied_by(self, file: File) -> bool:
        # Check if the file satisfies all spec
        return all(spec.is_satisfied_by(file) for spec in self.spec)

class OrSpec(FileSpec):
    def __init__(self, *spec: FileSpec):
        self.spec = spec

    def is_satisfied_by(self, file: File) -> bool:
        # Check if the file satisfies any of the spec
        return any(spec.is_satisfied_by(file) for spec in self.spec)
```


## !!steps File Search

5. `FileSearcher` class responsible for searching files based on a given speci. It takes a list of files and uses the speci to filter them.
6. `FileSearchBuilder` class provides a fluent interface for constructing complex file search spec.
It allows users to add spec incrementally and build either an AND or OR combination.

```python !code
class FileSearcher:
    def __init__(self, files: List[File]):
        self.files = files

    def find(self, speci: FileSpec) -> List[File]:
        # Filter files based on the provided speci
        return [file for file in self.files if speci.is_satisfied_by(file)]

class FileSearchBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spec = []

    def with_extension(self, extension: str):
        self.spec.append(ExtensionSpec(extension))
        return self

    def with_size(self, size: int, comparator: str):
        self.spec.append(SizeSpec(size, comparator))
        return self

    def build_and(self):
        return AndSpec(*self.spec)

    def build_or(self):
        return OrSpec(*self.spec)
```

## !!steps Example Usage

7. The use of the `FileSearchBuilder` allows for easy modification and chaining of search criteria, making the code modular and reusable.

```python !code
files = [...]  # List of File objects

searcher = FileSearcher(files)

# Build a search for files with .txt extension AND size > 1000
builder = FileSearchBuilder()
speci = builder.with_extension('.txt').with_size(1000, '>').build_and()
result = searcher.find(speci)

# Build a search for files with .txt OR .md extension
builder = FileSearchBuilder()
speci = builder.with_extension('.txt').with_extension('.md').build_or()
result = searcher.find(speci)
```

## Common Questions

### **How can new search criteria be added to the API?**
    - Extensibility: To add a new search criterion (e.g., by date modified), simply create a new class that implements FileSpec:

    ```python
    class DateModifiedSpecification(FileSpec):
        def __init__(self, date):
            self.date = date

    def is_satisfied_by(self, file):
        return file.date_modified >= self.date
    ```

    - Integration: This new speci can be integrated into the FileSearchBuilder without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. Users can now chain this new criterion:

    ```python
    search_spec = builder.with_extension('.txt').with_size(1024).with_date_modified('2023-01-01').build()
    ```
    
### **What are the potential drawbacks of this design?**

    - Performance: If the file list is large, filtering may become slow. Each spec checks every file, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.
    - Complexity: Introducing many spec can complicate the codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain. It's important to document each spec clearly.

### **How would you modify this design to add caching for frequently used searches?**
    - Cache Decorator: Wrap the FileSearcher with a caching layer to store results of frequently executed searches:

    ```python
    class CachedFileSearcher(FileSearcher):
        def __init__(self, searcher):
            self.searcher = searcher
            self.cache = {}

        def search(self, spec):
            key = str(spec)  # Generate a unique key based on spec
            if key in self.cache:
                return self.cache[key]
            results = self.searcher.search(spec)
            self.cache[key] = results
            return results
    ```
    - LRU Cache: Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for search results to manage memory effectively.
    - Cache Key: The cache key can be based on the parameters used in the spec.
    - Cache Invalidation: Ensure to invalidate the cache when files change to maintain accuracy.

### **How does this design handle error cases and invalid inputs?**
    - Input Validation: Validate inputs in the constructors of specifications to ensure they are valid:

    ```python
    class SizeSpec(FileSpec):
        def __init__(self, size):
            if size < 0:
                raise ValueError("Size must be non-negative")
            self.size = size
    ```
    - Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in the `is_satisfied_by` methods to catch unexpected issues.
    - Custom Exceptions: Use custom exceptions for different error cases to provide clearer feedback.
    - Builder Validation: Add validation in the Builder methods to ensure that the search criteria are valid before execution.
   

### **How would you make this design thread-safe?**
    - Immutable File Objects: Make File objects immutable to prevent concurrent modifications.
    - Thread-Safe Collections: Use thread-safe collections (like queue.Queue) for the file list.
    - Synchronization: Implement synchronization in FileSearcher if needed to prevent race conditions.

### **How would you optimize the search performance for large file systems?**
    - Indexing: Implement indexing for common search criteria to speed up lookups.
    ```python
    class FileIndexer:
        def __init__(self):
            self.index = {}

        def index_file(self, file):
            # Index by extension
            if file.extension not in self.index:
                self.index[file.extension] = []
            self.index[file.extension].append(file)
    ```
    - Parallel Processing: Use parallel processing (e.g., concurrent.futures) to handle large file lists efficiently.
    - Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for file attributes to reduce memory usage.
    - Early Termination: Add early termination options for searches to stop processing once a certain condition is met, improving performance.
