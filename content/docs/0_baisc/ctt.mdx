Below is a visual representation of different algorithm complexities and their common use cases:

<AlgorithmComplexity />

The table helps quickly identify viable solution approaches based on the input size (n) and time limits (typically 1-2 seconds).

| Constraint      | Time Complexity           | Tags                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| n ≈ 10^8       | O(log n)  / O(√n) / O(1)   | Math, GCD/LCM, Fast Power, Binary Representation, Prime Numbers |
| n ≈ 10^6       | O(n)                       | Two Pointers, Stack/Queue, Hash Table/Set, Prefix Sum, Greedy, 1D-DP, BFS/DFS on Tree, Topological Sort, Union Find |
| n ≈ 10^5       | O(n log n)                 | Sorting (Merge/Quick), Binary Search, Heap/Priority Queue, Tree Map/Set, Segment Tree, Intervals |
| n ≈ 10^4       | O(n²)                      | 2D-DP, Matrix Operations, Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS), Shortest Path (Bellman-Ford), Palindrome |
| n ≈ 200        | O(n³)                      | 3D-DP, Floyd Warshall, All Pairs Shortest Path, Three Pointers |
| n ≈ 20         | O(2^n) / O(n!)             | Backtracking, Bitmask DP, Subset Generation,  Permutations, Combinations |
