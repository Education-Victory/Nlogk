## Use Cases

| Use Case                          | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inorder Traversal Without Recursion or Stack | Perform an **inorder traversal** of a binary tree without using recursion or additional stack space. | For the tree `[1, null, 2, 3]`, the inorder traversal is `[1, 3, 2]`.   |
| Space-Efficient Tree Traversal    | Traverse a binary tree in **O(1) space** (excluding the result storage).    | Useful for large trees where stack space is limited.                    |
| Modifying Tree Structure Temporarily | Temporarily modify the tree structure to create links for traversal, then restore it. | Morris Traversal uses **threaded binary trees** to achieve this.        |

## Code Template

<Scrollycoding>

## !!steps Initialize traversal

1. Start with the `current` node as the root of the tree.
2. Use a `result` list to store the inorder traversal values.

```python !code
# !mark(1:3) gold
def inorder_traversal(self, root):
    current = root
    result = []
```

## !!steps Traverse the tree

3. If the `current` node has no left child, add its value to the result and move to the right child.
4. If the `current` node has a left child, find its **inorder predecessor** (the rightmost node in the left subtree).

```python !code
def inorder_traversal(self, root):
    current = root
    result = []

    # !mark(1:8) gold
    while current:
        if not current.left:
            result.append(current.val)
            current = current.right
        else:
            predecessor = current.left
            while predecessor.right and predecessor.right != current:
                predecessor = predecessor.right
```

## !!steps Modify and restore the tree

5. If the predecessor's right child is `None`, make `current` the right child of the predecessor (temporary link).
6. If the predecessor's right child is already `current`, revert the link and add `current`'s value to the result.

```python !code
def inorder_traversal(self, root):
    current = root
    result = []

    while current:
        if not current.left:
            result.append(current.val)
            current = current.right
        else:
            predecessor = current.left
            while predecessor.right and predecessor.right != current:
                predecessor = predecessor.right
            # !mark(1:9) gold
            if not predecessor.right:
                predecessor.right = current
                current = current.left
            else:
                predecessor.right = None
                result.append(current.val)
                current = current.right
    return result
```

</Scrollycoding>

## Common Mistakes

1. Incorrect Predecessor Link:
```python
# Wrong: Not checking if predecessor.right is already current
if not predecessor.right:
    predecessor.right = current
    current = current.left
# Correct:
if not predecessor.right:
    predecessor.right = current
    current = current.left
else:
    predecessor.right = None
    result.append(current.val)
    current = current.right
```

2. Skipping Nodes
```python
# Wrong: Moving to the right child without adding the current node's value
if not current.left:
    current = current.right  # Missing result.append(current.val)
# Correct:
if not current.left:
    result.append(current.val)
    current = current.right
```

3. Infinite Loop
```python
# Wrong: Not reverting the predecessor link
if not predecessor.right:
    predecessor.right = current
    current = current.left
# Correct:
if not predecessor.right:
    predecessor.right = current
    current = current.left
else:
    predecessor.right = None
    result.append(current.val)
    current = current.right
```

## Issues and Considerations

- Tree Modification: Morris Traversal temporarily modifies the tree structure by creating threaded links. Ensure the tree is restored to its original state after traversal.
- Space Complexity: While Morris Traversal uses O(1) space, it is not suitable for immutable trees or environments where tree modification is prohibited.
- Performance: Morris Traversal has a time complexity of O(n) but may have higher constant factors due to tree modifications.
