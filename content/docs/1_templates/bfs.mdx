## Use Cases

| Use Case   | Description     | Example      |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree       | Given a binary tree, return the values of its nodes in level order (breadth-first).            | For the tree: 1, with children 2 and 3, and 2's children 4 and 5, and 3's children 6 and 7. The result is [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]. |
| Finding Maximum Value at Each Level           | Find the maximum value of nodes at each level of the binary tree.                              | For the tree: 1, with children 2 and 3. The result is [1, 3].                             |
| Checking for Completeness of a Binary Tree    | Verify if the binary tree is complete by checking if all levels are fully filled except possibly the last. | For the tree: 1, with children 2 and 3. The result is True (complete).                    |




## Code Template

## !!steps Initializing

1. `queue = deque([root])`: Initializes a double-ended queue (deque) with the root node of the tree. The deque is used for efficient FIFO (first-in, first-out) operations, allowing us to easily add nodes to the end and remove nodes from the front as we traverse the tree.


```python !code
# !mark(1:3) gold
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
```


## !!steps While loop

2. `while queue:` This line starts a loop that continues as long as there are nodes in the queue. It ensures that we process each level of the tree until all nodes have been visited.
3. `level_size = len(queue):` This line calculates the number of nodes at the current level by getting the length of the queue. This value, level_size, will be used to determine how many nodes to process in this iteration of the loop.
4. `level = []:` This line initializes an empty list named level. It will temporarily store the values of the nodes that are processed at the current level before adding them to the main result list.

```python !code
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
    # !mark(1:3) gold
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
```

## !!steps Loop over queue

5. `for _ in range(level_size):` Starts a loop that will iterate level_size times, where level_size is the number of nodes at the current level. The underscore _ is used as a variable name to indicate that the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
6. `node = queue.popleft():` Removes and retrieves the leftmost (or front) node from the queue. The popleft() method is specific to deques and is efficient for removing elements from the front. The variable node now holds the current node being processed.
7. `level.append(node.val):` Adds the value of the current node (accessed via node.val) to the level list. This collects the values of all nodes at the current level in the level list for later use.


```python !code
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
        # !mark(1:3) gold
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
```

## !!steps Update queue

8. `if node.left:` Checks if the current node (stored in the variable node) has a left child. If the left child exists (i.e., it is not None), the following line will execute.
9. `queue.append(node.left):` If the left child exists, this line adds the left child node to the end of the queue. This ensures that the left child will be processed in subsequent iterations of the BFS loop.
10. `result.append(level):` Adds the list level, which contains the values of all nodes at the current level of the tree or graph, to the result list. The result list is designed to store the values of nodes level by level, effectively capturing the structure of the traversal.


```python !code
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            # !mark(1:6) gold
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(level)
    return result
```

## Common mistakes
1. Wrong Queue Initialization
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: not checking for null root
    queue = deque([root])  # Will fail if root is None
# ❌ Wrong: using list instead of deque
    queue = [root]  # O(n) for popleft operation
# ✅ Correct:
    if not root:
        return []
    queue = deque([root])  # O(1) for popleft operation
```

2. Wrong Queue Operation
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: using pop() instead of popleft()
    node = queue.pop()  # Gets right-most instead of left-most
# ❌ Wrong: using append() on wrong side
    queue.appendleft(node.left)  # Adds in wrong order
# ✅ Correct:
    node = queue.popleft()  # FIFO order
    queue.append(node.left)  # Add to right side
```

3. Wrong Child Node Check
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: missing null check
    queue.append(node.left)  # Will fail if left is None
    queue.append(node.right)
# ❌ Wrong: wrong order of checks
    if node and node.left:  # Redundant if node is already checked
# ✅ Correct:
    if node.left:
        queue.append(node.left)
    if node.right:
        queue.append(node.right)
```

## Issues and consideration
- `BFS VS DFS:` BFS is ideal for scenarios where you need the shortest path or to explore nodes level by level. DFS is better suited for problems that require exploring all possible options or paths, especially when the solution is deep in the tree or graph.
