## Use Cases

| Use Case     | Description    | Example     |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Preorder Traversal of a Binary Tree          | Given a binary tree, return the values of its nodes in preorder (root, left, right) traversal. | For the tree: 1, with children 2 and 3, and 2's children 4 and 5. The result is [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]. |
| Finding All Paths from Root to Leaves        | Find all paths from the root to each leaf node in the binary tree.                            | For the tree: 1 with children 2 and 3, and 2's children 4 and 5. The result is [[1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3]]. |
| Checking for Symmetry of a Binary Tree       | Check if the binary tree is symmetric around its center.                                       | For the tree: 1 with children 2 and 2 (both having children 3 and 3). The result is True (symmetric). |




## Code Template


<Scrollycoding>

## !!steps Basic case

1. `dfs()` takes two parameters: root (the current node) and result (a list to store node values).
2. `if not root:` checks if the current node is None. If it is, the function returns immediately.

```python !code
# !mark(1:3) gold
def dfs(root, result):
    if not root:
        return
```

## !!steps Collect node value

3. It collects node values during the DFS traversal, helping to track the order of processed nodes.

```python !code
def dfs(root, result):
    if not root:
        return
    # !mark(1:2) gold
    result.append(root.val)
```

## !!steps Loop over queue

4. Recursively calls `dfs()` on each child, allowing traversal of both subtrees.


```python !code
def dfs(root, result):
    if not root:
        return
    result.append(root.val)

    # !mark(1:2) gold
    for child in (root.left, root.right):
        dfs(child, result)
```

## Issues and consideration
- `BFS VS DFS:` BFS is ideal for scenarios where you need the shortest path or to explore nodes level by level. DFS is better suited for problems that require exploring all possible options or paths, especially when the solution is deep in the tree or graph.
