## Use Cases

| Use Case      | Description       | Example     |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Topological Sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) | Given a directed acyclic graph, return a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge  u to v , vertex  u  comes before vertex v. | For the graph with edges: A → B, A → C, B → D, C → D, one possible result is [A, B, C, D]. |
| Course Scheduling     | Given a list of courses and their prerequisites, determine an order to take the courses.   | For courses: `{0: [], 1: [0], 2: [1]}`, a valid order could be [0, 1, 2].           |



## Code Template

## !!steps Initialization

1. `indegree = defaultdict(int):` Store the indegree (number of incoming edges) for each node in the graph. It initializes the count to zero for any node that hasn't been encountered yet.
2. `queue = deque([node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0]):` A deque (double-ended queue) is initialized with nodes that have an indegree of zero. These are the starting points for the topological sort, as they don't have any prerequisites.

```python !code
# !mark(1:4) gold
def topological_sort(graph):
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0])
    result = []
    indegree = defaultdict(int)
```

## !!steps Calculate node indegree

3. The outer loop goes through each `node` in the graph. The inner loop processes each `nei` of the current `node`.
4. The indegree of each `nei` is incremented by 1, counting how many edges point to it.

```python !code
def topological_sort(graph):
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0])
    result = []
    indegree = defaultdict(int)
    # !mark(1:3) gold
    for node in graph:
        for nei in graph[node]:
            indegree[nei] += 1
```

## !!steps Processes node

5. `while queue:` This loop continues as long as there are nodes in the `queue`. The `queue` contains nodes that are ready to be processed (i.e., they have zero indegree).
6. `node = queue.popleft():` The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first node from the queue. This node is the next one to be processed in the topological order. 

```python !code
def topological_sort(graph):
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0])
    result = []
    indegree = defaultdict(int)
    for node in graph:
        for nei in graph[node]:
            indegree[nei] += 1

    # !mark(1:3) gold
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
```

## !!steps Updating indegrees

7. `for nei in graph[node]:` This loop goes through each `nei` of the current `node`. These are the nodes that are directly reachable from `node`.
8. `indegree[nei] -= 1:` The indegree of the `nei` is decreased by 1. This reflects that one incoming edge (from `node` to `nei`) has been processed.
9. `if indegree[nei] == 0:` After decrementing, Checks if the `nei` now has an indegree of zero. This means there are no remaining incoming edges to this node.
10. `queue.append(nei):` If the indegree is zero, the `nei` is added to the `queue`, making it ready to be processed in subsequent iterations.

```python !code
def topological_sort(graph):
    queue = deque([node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0])
    result = []
    indegree = defaultdict(int)
    for node in graph:
        for nei in graph[node]:
            indegree[nei] += 1

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        # !mark(1:5) gold
        for nei in graph[node]:
                indegree[nei] -= 1
                if indegree[nei] == 0:
                    queue.append(nei)
    return result
```

## Common mistakes

1. Wrong Cycle Detection
```python
# Wrong: missing cycle detection
return result  # Always returns result without checking for cycles
# Correct:
if len(result) != len(graph):  # Check if all nodes are visited
    return []  # or raise exception for cycle detection
return result
```

2. Wrong Queue Operation
```python
# Wrong: using pop() instead of popleft()
node = queue.pop()  # Gets last element instead of first
# Wrong: using append_left instead of append
queue.appendleft(nei)  # Adds to wrong end
# Correct:
node = queue.popleft()
queue.append(nei)
```

## Issues and consideration
- Ensure that the input graph is a valid directed acyclic graph (DAG). Topological sorting is only applicable to DAGs.
- If the graph has cycles, the algorithm will not produce a valid topological sort. You might want to check if the length of the result is equal to the number of nodes in the graph after processing. If not, it indicates a cycle.
