## Use Cases

| Use Case    | Description   | Example          |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Next Greater Element                               | Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. If there is no greater element, return -1. | For the array `[2, 1, 2, 4, 3]`, the next greater elements are `[4, 2, 4, -1, -1]`.                     |
| Next Smaller Element                               | Given an array of integers, find the next smaller element for each element in the array. If there is no smaller element, return -1. | For the array `[4, 5, 2, 10, 8]`, the next smaller elements are `[2, 2, -1, 8, -1]`.                    |


## Code Template


<Scrollycoding>

## !!steps  Initializes variables
1. `result = [-1] * n`: Creates a list of the same length as nums, initialized to -1. This will hold the next greater elements.
2. `stack = []`: Initializes an empty list to track indices of elements in nums during iteration.


```python !code
# !mark(1:4) gold
def next_greater_elements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []
```

## !!steps Check for next greater element

3. Checks if the `stack` is not empty and if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than the element at the index on the top of the stack.
4. If both conditions are true, it means `nums[i]` is the next greater element for the index at the top of the `stack`, and we pop indices from the `stack` until this condition is false.

```python !code
def next_greater_elements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []

    # !mark(1:2) gold
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
```

## !!steps Append current index to stack
5. Retrieves the `index` from the `stack` and updates the result list with the current element `nums[i]` as its next greater element.
6. Adds the current index `i` to the `stack` for future comparisons.



```python !code
def next_greater_elements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [-1] * n
    stack = []

    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
            # !mark(1:4) gold
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = nums[i]
        stack.append(i)
    return result
```

## Common mistakes
1. Wrong Stack Comparison Direction
```python code
# ❌ Wrong:
    while stack and nums[stack[-1]] > nums[i]:  # Finds next smaller element
# ✅ Correct:
    while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:  # Finds next greater element
```

2. Wrong Stack Content Storage
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: storing values instead of indices
    stack.append(nums[i])  # Can't track original positions
    result[stack.pop()] = nums[i]  # Will cause error
# ✅ Correct:
    stack.append(i)  # Store indices to track positions
    index = stack.pop()
    result[index] = nums[i]
```

3. Wrong Result Array Initialization
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: using empty list or zeros
    result = []  # Can't index into empty list
    result = [0] * n  # Can't distinguish between actual 0 and no answer
# ✅ Correct:
    result = [-1] * n  # Use -1 to indicate no greater element found
```

4. Wrong Stack Empty Check
```python code
# ❌ Wrong: missing stack check
    while nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:  # Will error on empty stack
# ❌ Wrong: wrong order of conditions
    while nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i] and stack:  # Will error
# ✅ Correct:
    while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:  # Check stack first
```
