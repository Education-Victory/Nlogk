### General

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="The interviewer is not listening or seems impatient">
    ### Possible reasons
    - Tired: If the interviewer has interviewed many candidates, they might feel tired and lose focus.
    - Lack of interest: The interviewer may not be interested in the candidate's background or answers, leading to distraction.
    - Different communication styles: The candidate's way of speaking might not match the interviewer's expectations, causing understanding issues.

    ### Solutions
    - Confirm understanding: Ask question to make sure you are on the same page.
      > Just to clarify, you mentioned [insert statement here]. Is that accurate?
      >
      > Can you give an example to help me understand better?
      >
      > Were the points I mentioned clear? Is there something you want to know more about?
    - Create interaction: Ask questions or engage the interviewer to grab their attention and make the conversation more engaging.
      > Do you think I understand and solve the problem fast enough? Anything I can do to improve?
      >
      > Did I clearly explain my idea while solving the problems? What can I do to improve our communication?
    - Simplify information: If the interviewer looks tired, try to simplify your answers and highlight the most important points.
      > To save time, can I summarize my key achievements in this project?
      >
      > Overall, my strength is that I can manage projects and teams effectively under pressure to ensure timely completion.

    - Testing problem-solving ability: They observe how candidates analyze and solve complex or novel problems.
    - Evaluating communication skills: They watch how candidates express their thoughts and ideas during the thinking process.

    ### Solutions
    - **Lower expectations:** Admit that you have never prepared for such questions and will do your best to answer based on your experience.
    - **Try to propose multiple solutions:** Make an effort to present several options to show your diverse thinking abilities.
    - **Use known knowledge:** Try to find similar questions and apply your previous experiences to this new question, looking for similarities.

      > That's an interesting question; thank you for asking. Although it's not related to my professional experience, I'd be happy to share my thoughts.
    - Guide back to the topic: Steer the conversation back to job-related topics.
      > I'm glad to discuss this topic, but if possible, I'd also like to share my relevant experience in this area.
    - Use the opportunity to showcase diversity: Highlight your diversity and adaptability.
      > I'm also interested in this topic, which allows me to bring different perspectives to the team. For exampleâ€¦
  </Accordion>

### Algorithm related

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Understand: Unable to understand the problem or miss some key conditions">
    ### Solutions
    - Summarize known conditions: List requirements to clarify thoughts.
      > Let me summarize the keypoints in the question: we have..., and the goal is...
    - Use test case to understand: Use a simple testcase to walk through the question
      > Let me use a testcase to help me understand this problem ...so if the input it, the output it, because ...
    - Communicate actively: Maintain dialogue with interviewer.
      > My current understanding is this; do you think that's correct?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analyze: The problem looks too difficult">
    ### Solutions
    - Identify keywords: Look for features that hint at algorithm type.
      > The mention of parentheses handling might relate to stack algorithms.
    - Use problem-solving strategies: Try various approaches.
      > The brute-force solution is ..., Let me see how to optimize from it. 
      > 
      > Let me first try to solve a simpler problem.
      >
      > Let me try to break it down to smaller problem
      > 
      > Let me try reverse thinking
    - Use default toolkit: Review common algorithm categories.

    - Ask for hints: Politely request hints or directions from the interviewer.
      > I have several ideas in my mind. I guess we can try dynamic programming or greedy, Do you think we can start from this two idea?
    - Suggest changing the question: For particularly niche topics (like geometry, game theory), you can request to change the question. But don't expect the new question to be simpler. Impact depends on how tricky the original question was.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Analyze: Spending too much time discussing solution details">
    ### Solutions
    - Focus on overall idea: Emphasize framework over details.
      > Tthe overall idea is..., if you are agreed with me. We can discuss the details during implementation.

  <Accordion title="Implement: Being asked to use a specific programming language">
    ### Solutions
    - Stick to your own ideas: Explain your preferred language choice.
