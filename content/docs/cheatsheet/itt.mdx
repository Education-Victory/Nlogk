| Input Type   | Questions    | Points to consider        |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Integer**  | What is the range of the input (e.g., 32-bit signed integer)? | Are there rounding requirements (floor, ceiling, nearest integer)?<br />How to handle 0 (possible to divide 0?)<br />Should negative inputs be treated differently? |
| **String**   | What is the length of the string?<br />What character the string may contain?<br /> | Are there case sensitivity or whitespace constraints?<br />Are there specific patterns (e.g., palindromes, anagrams, unique)?|
| **Array**    | What is the size of the array?<br />What is the range of values in the array?    | Are there specific patterns(e.g., sorted, unique)?<br />Are there constraints on the input type (e.g., integers, strings)? |
| **LinkedList** | What is the length of the linked list?<br />What is the range of node values?   | Is the linked list singly or doubly linked?<br />Are there cycles in the list?<br />Are there special constraints (e.g., sorted, circular)? |
| **Matrix**   | What are the size (rows Ã— columns) of the matrix?<br />What is the range of values in the matrix?   | Are there specific patterns (e.g., binary, diagonal, symmetric)?<br />Are there sparse or dense constraints? |
| **Tree**     | How many nodes are in the tree?<br />What is the range of node values?   | What type of tree is it (BST, Trie, etc.)?<br />Is it a perfect, full, or complete binary tree?<br />Are there parent pointers or other special properties? |
| **Graph**    | How many nodes and edges are there?<br />What is the range of node/edge values?     | How is the graph represented (adjacency matrix, adjacency list, etc.)?<br />Is the graph connected or disconnected?<br />Is it a simple graph (no loops/multiple edges)?|
